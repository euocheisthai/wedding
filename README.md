Wedding errands time frame calculator, written for the single purpose of helping my beloved (and myself, to be fair) to adjust our actions without worrying too much.

**to do**: 
- actually display dates in order
- add modes (paranoid, optimistic, docs are ready too soon, docs are taking too long)

**to run**: `cargo run -- 2025-03-01` - like this, fill in the starting date 

**example ouput**:

```
1. Start gathering documents: 2025-03-01
2. Docs ready by (approx, worst case): 2025-05-15
3. Docs expire by (always 6 mon): 2025-11-11
4. Apply for visa (takes 3 mon): 2025-05-15
5. Visa should be ready by (approx, worst case): 2025-08-13
6. Latest Civil Registry appt while docs are still valid: 2025-09-12
7. Civil Registry appt to schedule at (earliest possible, 4 mon in advance):   2025-05-15
